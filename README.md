# BattleTechSheet
BattleTech interactable sheet in Python3 + TKinter

In this program you can choose a few mechs and produce an interactible sheet. The program extracts apropriate data from the attached .csv file and simulates mech's armor/internal structure/components. 

At the moment not all the fucntionality is done but you can still try some fun stuff. The sheet tracks the engine/gyro/sensors/life support damage, number of heat sinks, through-armor crits, components/armor/internal structure damage and sudden limb detachment (and ammo explosion!). There are two buttons to do 5 and 20 damage to a chosen (or a random!) location as well as a few test buttons/fucntions. 

Test functions include:
1. Ammo explosion simulator ("Left Torso Crit") - works the best with Catapult CPLT-C1. Click a few times and the ammo will explode.
2. Center Torso 1 damage hit - to test the crits to the engine and other important parts
3. Through armor crits simulator (also for 1 damage)

There is also a reset button to resent the program insted of restarting it manually.

It is just a personal project of mine. So, feel free to use the code in parts or entirety if desired (mention will be appreciated). Also, feedback will be appreciated as well - I will continue working on this project when I have time...
